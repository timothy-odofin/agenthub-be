AgentHub – Concept Summary
Purpose

AgentHub is a modular AI assistant platform that acts as a central hub for:

Connecting to multiple knowledge sources (Confluence, internal docs, etc.)

Integrating with developer/enterprise tools (Jira, GitHub, Bitbucket)

Providing AI-driven task support, clarifications, and RAG-style answers

Orchestrating multiple “tools” via an agent layer

Key Features

Agent orchestration: AI agent decides which tool or knowledge source to query.

Knowledge retrieval (RAG): Uses vector embeddings to find relevant content from documents.

Tool integrations: Jira, GitHub, Bitbucket, Confluence, and more via pluggable adapters.

Chat interface: Session-based, supports streaming responses, stores conversation history.

Extensibility: Easy to add new tool adapters, vector DBs, or alternative frontend interfaces.

Backend Architecture

FastAPI: API layer

Postgres + pgvector: Stores chat history, metadata, embeddings

Redis: Cache and Celery broker

Celery worker: Handles background jobs like embedding ingestion and document updates

Services:

Agent orchestration

Retriever (semantic search)

Tool adapters (Jira, GitHub, Confluence)

Frontend Architecture

React app: Chat interface, session management

Service layer: Abstracts API calls, making future plugin/Web Component conversion easy

State management: Handles sessions, threads, streaming responses

OSS & Extensibility Focus

Modular design for easy open-source contribution

Config-driven integration with multiple tools

Default setup with Postgres + pgvector, but pluggable vector DBs supported

Frontend designed to be isolated and portable

Future Enhancements

Web Component / plugin version for embedding in other websites or apps

Analytics dashboard for LLM usage and tool interactions

Multi-tenant support for enterprise deployment
